				<p>	My name is Oscar Aguirre, I am a transfer here at UCSC. I am studying studio art because I enjoy making art. I am currently teaching myself to tattoo and have even organized a small community of people who are willing to tattoo each other here at UCSC. I have some coding experience. My friends are computer science majors and gamers so I found myself curious about programming. I taught myself some python which led down a rabbit hole where I changed my major and took some java and c++ classes. I enjoyed it because it was like a challenging logic puzzle, but constantly coding and doing math made me depressed. I think this class will reignite my passion for coding because it allows me to combine art and technology.
